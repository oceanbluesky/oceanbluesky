The near-infinite resources offered through development of our Solar System provide a unique solution set to many of humanity's most pressing challenges. With an optimistic passion for science, exploration, and storytelling, I enjoy collaborating with research, engineering, and narrative teams to improve the way we bring into being our shared future. 
</p>
<p>
From research, brainstorming, and ideation, to wireframe prototyping and narrative visualizations, multidisciplinary project teams can be led to create smart, beautiful, informative and useful design through fast iteration, frequent A/B testing, visionary expectations, and zero-ego, open, sincere, plus-up communication. Excellence is the passing grade. Let's figure it out and make amazing things.

Development of the near infinite resources, energy, and knowledge in space offers a unique solution set to many of humanity's most pressing challenges. As a lifelong learner with a passion for science and exploration, I enjoy collaborating with diverse science, engineering, and narrative teams to create concept art, visual presentations, animated stories, and graphic assets to improve the way we think about interactive storytelling and the human condition. 

Recently I've enjoyed developing 3D assets for long-term personal projects using Arduino and the Raspberry PI, Oculus, Qt and Python/C++, as applied to telerobotics, VR, and AI.
 
From research, brainstorming, and ideation, to wireframe prototyping and narrative visualizations, I believe multidisciplinary teams can be led to create smart, beautiful, informative design through fast iteration, frequent A/B testing, visionary expectations, and zero-ego, open, sincere, plus-up communication. Let's figure it out.
