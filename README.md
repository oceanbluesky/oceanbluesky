The near-infinite resources offered through development of our Solar System provide a unique solution set to many of humanity's most pressing challenges. With an optimistic passion for science, exploration, and storytelling, I enjoy collaborating with research, engineering, and narrative teams to improve the way bring into being our shared future. 

From research, brainstorming, and ideation, to wireframe prototyping and narrative visualizations, multidisciplinary project teams can be led to create smart, beautiful, informative and useful design through fast iteration, frequent A/B testing, visionary expectations, and zero-ego, open, sincere, plus-up communication. Excellence is the passing grade. Let's figure it out and make beautiful things happen.
